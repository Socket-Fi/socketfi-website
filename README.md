# SoroBuild

##### _SoroBuild is an infrastructure project that provide users and projects with a nocode Soroban contract and dApp development, testing/deployment and management environment._

SoroBuild is a no-code Soroban dApp development and management enviroment that provide developers building on the Soroban smart contracts platform with the tools to build, test, and deploy dApps faster. Additionally, it provides contract management features, allowing developers to seamlessly interact with their dApp, facilitating the ability to test dApps integration with UI and wallets, without having to build any of these components.

### Features

SoroBuild has 3 main features but, here we focus on one of our main freatures outlined below:

No-code soroban smart contract deployment, invocation and management tool:
SoroBuild provides developers and projects with a no-code Soroban smart contract tool that facilitates seamless deployment and invocation of smart contracts. This tool aims to reduce setup time and the time spent by less experienced developers in debugging, deployment, and invoking common Soroban smart contracts and libraries. For example, a project requiring token deployment solely for testing their dApp need not invest significant time in doing so. Instead, they can use this tool to deploy, initialize, and mint test tokens in under 5 minutes. This tool also offers the deployment and interaction with other smart contracts like liquidity/staking and governance contracts, among others.
You can try out the tool at: https://www.sorobuild.io/contracts
